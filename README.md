## TL;DR

This tool allows you to save a lot of time writing commands with totally custom shortcuts, that you can share on the project with your "human" team or machines, with a unique code on the same place. #agile #needForSpeed. 
 
> Like `scripts` of `package.json` but with _steroids_.

**Notes:** The idea is not to drop the console; it's for optimising it!
  
### Features

* Multi-platform: An only code that works on all platforms. Powered by [nodejs](https://nodejs.org)
* Templates for easy reuse
* It does not matter what kind of project is, if you write commands this tool can be helpful for you
* There are five source types of variables: Predefined, environment, package.json, templates and shortcuts.
* Devs and DevOps can be friends with it because they can share their scripts.
* Typo on long command lines are past problems!
* Do away with one thousand of similar scripts on your `package.json`!  
(`build`, `build-ci`, `build-prod`, `build-prod-ci`, `build-qa`, `build-qa-ci`, `build-ci-cache`, etc...)
* The `scripts` on the `package.json` were modified and have to `rebuild` your docker image, never again!
* **Without dependencies from other modules!**
